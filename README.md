final-project
=============
I've created a basic algorithm that sorts a list of random numbers. 
My html page displays a list of numbers in random order. The user clicks the button below for the results of the list of
numbers in order. In addition, I added a restart button that reloads the html page. (I've used loops in the past to achieve this before but wanted to try something new this go around.)


I've used: codeKhan, codecademy, lynda, blogs and treehouse for sources.
I did not collaborate with anyone.
